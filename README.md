# BenchmarkST

We present a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art methods for cell/spot clustering, integration, and alignment on spatial transcriptomic datasets. Our goal is to provide the research field with a fair evaluation and comparison of all available methods to facilitate the usersâ€™ choice as well as shed more light on further developments to focus on the challenging aspects of ST based tasks.

## Online documentation&tutorials

We hope the online readthedocs.io version of doc of our project BenchmarkST would make things easier and more organized. Feel free to navigate to it through the following link.

## Installation

We strongly suggest to follow the installation instructions given by each method. We will also provide the .yaml file of our debugging environment in each subfolder.

## Repository description
We provide all the jupyter notebooks in each subfolder to run and evaluate all algorithms for all datasets with ground truth annotation, and to reproduce the results introduced in our paper.


<!-- 1. '${algorithm_name}' folders contain mostly the original repo's content and code, but we also adapt a bit so that it could be run on the new datasets that have not been tested in their published paper.
2. 'analysis' folder constains script for reproducing the figures in our paper.

## General Usage

Please follow the readme or jupyter notebook instructions in each subfolder for further details.
